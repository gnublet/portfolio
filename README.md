Here is a sample of some of my projects to showcase my abilities:

##data visualization: datavis1.ipynb
A collection of useful datavisualization techniques in python. This includes the standard plots: scatterplots, histograms, qqplots, but I also added stuff for looking at high dimensions like the andrews curve, parallel coordinates, and the scatter matrix plot (which I find useful for medium sized datasets).

##video facial feature detection: face_detection.py
Using OpenCV, the program can detect faces, eyes, noses, and mouths in real time using Haar cascades.

##Housing price prediction: housing2.ipynb
Using XGBoost Regression, this script predicts housing prices on a Kaggle dataset. Accuracy can be increased if we lookup zipcode information.

##RSS news to speech: rss_to_speech.ipynb
This is a very short script to read important news taken from Reuters (to save time in my daily routine). This makes use of BeautifulSoup to clean data taken from rss feeds of your choice.
