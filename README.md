Here is a sample of some of my projects to showcase my abilities:

##data visualization: datavis1.ipynb
A collection of useful datavisualization techniques in python. This includes the standard plots: scatterplots, histograms, qqplots, but I also added stuff for looking at high dimensions like the andrews curve, parallel coordinates, and the scatter matrix plot (which I find useful for medium sized datasets).

##video facial feature detection: eye_face_kw.py
Using OpenCV, the program can detect faces, eyes, noses, and mouths in real time using Haar cascades.
